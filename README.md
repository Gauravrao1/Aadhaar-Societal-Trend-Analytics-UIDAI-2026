# Aadhaar Societal Trend Analytics – UIDAI Hackathon 2025

## 🔍 Problem Statement

Unlocking Societal Trends in Aadhaar Enrolment & Updates.

This project analyses Aadhaar enrolment data to identify meaningful patterns, trends, anomalies, and predictive indicators that support informed decision-making and system improvements for UIDAI.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

- Analyse temporal and regional enrolment patterns
- Detect seasonal demand peaks
- Identify high-load districts
- Detect anomalies in enrolment behaviour
- Propose data-driven operational solutions
- Support proactive governance planning

---

## 📊 Dataset Used

Source: UIDAI Open Data Portal (Hackathon 2026 Dataset)

### Key Attributes:

| Column | Description |
|--------|------------|
| date | Enrolment date |
| state | State name |
| district | District name |
| pincode | Location PIN code |
| age_0_5 | Enrolments (0–5 years) |
| age_5_17 | Enrolments (5–17 years) |
| age_18_greater | Enrolments (18+ years) |

## 🛠 Methodology

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
   - Date formatting
   - Feature engineering (month, year, total enrolment)

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - State-wise analysis
   - District load distribution
   - Age group segmentation

3. Advanced Visual Analytics
   - Seasonal Polar Charts
   - Lorenz Curve (load inequality)
   - Stress Heatmaps (Z-score based)
   - Calendar Heatmaps
   - Peak Demand Analysis

4. Anomaly Detection
   - Threshold-based spike detection
   - District-level pressure mapping

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Aadhaar enrolment follows a strong seasonal pattern.
- Peak demand months require proactive infrastructure scaling.
- Enrolment load is unevenly distributed across districts.
- Few districts handle disproportionately high enrolment volumes.
- Detectable anomaly spikes indicate seasonal campaigns or system stress.

---

## 🧠 Solution Framework

### 1️⃣ Seasonal Resource Planning
Predict peak demand months and allocate additional operators.

### 2️⃣ District Stress Monitoring
Identify high-pressure districts and deploy temporary enrolment centres.

### 3️⃣ Anomaly Alert System
Flag abnormal spikes for early intervention.

### 4️⃣ Data-Driven Dashboard
Interactive dashboard for policymakers.
